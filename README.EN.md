⚠️ This project is work in progress, do not use it in production. This is a temporary repository, made to facilitate development. When it's ready, it will replace the current Bootstrap Italia code.

New Bootstrap Italia version is a [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) theme to create responsive web apps to make Italian public digital services consistent, accessible and simple to use.

Bootstrap Italia inherits components, mixins, grid system, and anything else from Bootstrap 5, customising them accordingly to the [Italian guidelines for designing public digital services](https://docs.italia.it/italia/designers-italia/design-linee-guida-docs/).

The project roadmap is available in the [new Designers Italia 2022 activity plan](https://designers.italia.it/piano-attivita/).
